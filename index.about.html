              <h1>Metagascar Community Whitepaper</h1>
              <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
              <p>Diversity and community create better solutions to plan and grow an idea from inception to reality. Therefore, with love, respect, and togetherness, we will overcome all and drive a fairer and inclusive eco-system for all citizens of Metagascar.</p>

              <h2>Abstract</h2>
              <p>The Metagascar project was born from the need for people to connect at a higher level of consciousness.  The basic human need is to connect with like-minded individuals to share experiences, give advice and have fun that enriches and drives personal growth through community interaction.  Metagascar is uniquely doing this by building a digital version of a community to collaborate, interact, educate, and play games.  Essentially,  it will be a Non Fungible City.</p>

              <p>The current and the next generation are connected to the internet more than ever before. They'll be one step removed from the physical world. The metaverse will be interwoven in the fabric of their lives, from music, the arts to cross-continental communication. This new decentralized yet interconnected community of individuals will spend time online through avatars in virtual spaces on various platforms. Metagascar will be an excellent place for people to experience live music, education, mental health, drug rehab, and multiple forms of arts virtually for the first time. By enabling those who are geographically located in other parts of the country and world, they will have a safe place to interact with one another.</p>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>At its core, Metagascar is a LOOT NFT project which is the basis of the building block for the community to take the lead. The properties are set up in a community structure with a total of 20 lots per community. Their street name identifies each community. The lot size, home size, and home styles are the characteristics listed in the LOOT NFT.</p>

              <p>Metagascar will have a president and a vice president that the entire community will vote into office. Gastonian Punks OG NFT owners will be able to run for President.  Voting is cast via Gastonian Punk OG and Gastonian Punk NFTs.  Similarly, each community will have an HOA leader voted into office by their respective community.</p>


              <h2>Community</h2>

              <p>Each community will have a Homeowner Association (HOA). Property owners may elect a community board leader to represent the entire community's interest.  The 20th house in each community will be reserved as a common congregation area for property owners to socialize, propose changes, and cast votes.  The community member can submit proposals, i.e. change the street's name, allow holiday decorations, share resources, etc.</p>

              <p>There are 16,000 properties in Metagascar that are split between the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains. Properties identified from #1 to #1000 are reserved for landowners minted on the Polygon blockchain. As of this writing, properties from #1001 to #8000 are available for minting on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

              <h2>How to Buy Property in Metagascar</h2>

              <p>There are several options to buy a Metagascar property as indicated below. However, the Metagascar Map is a great reference  point to get familiarized with the greater community (add URL link here).</p>

              <h3>Option 1</h3>
              <p>Connect your wallet to  https://metagascar.tfnlab.com, then select the "view properties"  tab. Enter the property number you wish to purchase (i.e. 2000, 2010, 2013 etc.) under the "Enter Home No." menu. If the property is "unassigned," then scroll down to mint, select the ''mint'' button and approve the transaction to complete the purchase.</p>



              <p>Example: Property descriptions and associated attributes that is shown as “Home Owner Unassigned” as of this writing.</p>



              <h3>Option 2</h3>
              <p>Ensure your wallet is connected to the Ethereum mainnet and connect your wallet to Opensea https://opensea.io/collection/metagascar-eth.  Find a property of interest, select the ''buy now'' tab, and approve the transaction.</p>

              <h3>Option 3</h3>
              <p>Ensure your wallet is connected to the Polygon mainnet and connect your wallet to Opensea https://opensea.io/collection/metagascar.  Find a property of interest, select the buy now tab, and approve the transaction.</p>
              <h2>How to Develop Property</h2>
              <p>We are committed to open-source technology for flexibility and upgradability.  We believe this technology will improve over time, allowing us to migrate with ease.  Currently, there are several tools available to our community that help them realize their virtual dreams.</p>

              <p>If a community member wishes to customize a property and build from scratch, they can start with Blender, Autocad and Mozilla Spoke software.  Within the Mozilla Spoke environment, one can discover and explore 3D models for Sketchfab and Google Poly.  Members are in complete control of their creation.</p>

              <p>Alternatively, 3D homes are available for purchase from Sketchfab and Google Poly with a low poly count that requires minimal editing.  If editing is required, import the 3D image to Blender for final touches or reduce the poly count, i.e. remove furniture, adjust scene, change color, etc.  Upon completion, the 3D image can be uploaded to Sketchfab. Next, ensure that the 3D model matches the on-chain data (square-foot) of the property NFT.  Upon completion, in Mozilla Spoke, publish the project to Mozilla Hubs. Then submit the Mozilla Hubs URL link to Metagascar for approval.  Lastly, the Metagascar team will update the Web3 app database linking the NFT with the VR experience to your property.</p>

              <h2>Community Disputes</h2>
              <p>
              On occasion, disputes and miscommunication between a property owner and community member or hired help (i.e., developer, designer, etc.)might occur.  The Metagascar community as a whole will be able to participate in a jury trial.  Trials are held in the common community center (courtyard) with a judge.
            </p>
              <h2>Casting a Vote</h2>
              <p>
              The community will create a voting wallet (transparent process) and post the wallet address in the community courtyard.  Votes are cast by sending Gastonian Punk NFT to the specific wallet address. Two wallet addresses will be used if a dispute requires a" YES" or "No" vote. The duration to cast ballots will be similar to the real world.
            </p>
              <p>The respective community and presidential committee will manage the voting wallets. Upon completion of votes, the holders of the "voting wallet" may return the Gastonian NFT to the holders, place the NFT in the open marketplace to fund the community treasury, or use them to onboard new members. In short, the voting wallet creed is part of the movement. The community has the opportunity to creatively decide what to do with the NFTs accumulated in the voting wallets.</p>
              <p>The President</p>
              <p>The president of Metagascar will be responsible to review community collaboration and DAO related proposals.</p>
              <p>The Vice President</p>
              <p>The Vice President (VP) will assist the president with various tasks and responsibilities. The VP will be responsible for reviewing community collaboration and DAO related proposals.</p>
            </p>
              <h2>Government Continuity Plan</h2>
              <p>The President is Assassinated, Dies, Missing in Action, In Real Life Jail</p>
              <p>Voting ballot must be created to determine if one of the above conditions is true</p>
              <p>A Judge in Metagascar with multiple Judge roles must approve the request by casting a vote with “LA Punk” that has judge role.</p>
              <p>The Vice President will take charge of Metagascar</p>
              <p>The Treasury will raise funds for migration</p>
              <p>Sell VP voting ballot  “Gastonian Punk NFT”</p>
              <p>Sell Transition approval ballot</p>
              <p>
              The Vice President will serve the remainder of the term
            </p>

              “A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable.[1] NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. Access to any copy of the original file, however, is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies of these digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with a proof of ownership that is separate from copyright” - (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token…).

              “Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks” - (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain).

              “Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The most well-known types are copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. The modern concept of intellectual property developed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. The term "intellectual property" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world's legal systems” - (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property…).
